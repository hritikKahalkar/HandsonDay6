Write a program to accept name and age of a person from the command prompt(passed as arguments when you execute the class) and ensure that the age entered is >=18 and < 60.

Display proper error messages.

The program must exit gracefully after displaying the error message in case the arguments passed are not proper.

 (Hint : Create a user defined exception class for handling errors.)*/
